\# ü§ñ Obstacle Avoidance Robot Using Ultrasonic Sensor



This project presents a simple autonomous robot capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and motor control via an L298N H-Bridge motor driver. The robot is built on a stable chassis and powered by a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno).



---



\## üîß Hardware Setup



\- Construct a stable robot chassis that holds all components: Arduino uno, ultrasonic sensor, L298N motor driver, motors, wheels, and power supply.

\- Ensure the components are securely fixed and the chassis provides proper balance for movement.



---



\## üîå Sensor Integration



\- \*\*Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)\*\* is interfaced with the Arduino.

\- It continuously measures the distance to obstacles in the robot‚Äôs path using time-of-flight echo detection.

\- The sensor data is processed in real-time to identify nearby obstacles.



---



\## ‚öôÔ∏è Motor Control



\- \*\*L298N H-Bridge motor driver\*\* is used to drive the two DC motors.

\- The direction and speed of the motors are controlled through Arduino PWM and digital pins.

\- Motor speed is dynamically adjusted based on the proximity of obstacles.



---



\## üß† Obstacle Avoidance Logic



\- The robot reads ultrasonic distance data continuously.

\- If an obstacle is detected within a specified range (e.g., < 20 cm), the robot:

&nbsp; - Stops

&nbsp; - Turns left or right based on a predefined strategy

\- If the path is clear, the robot continues moving forward.
